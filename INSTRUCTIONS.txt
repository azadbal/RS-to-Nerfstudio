create a project folder anywhere, and name it what you want your project and splats to be name
place the images into root/images
	you can have subdirs. it'll read the full folder
		you can even have _geometry and _texture layers. not an issue
	if you have raw images, move those to root/raw
copy these BAT files to the project root
run them one by one
